# People

### Getting it running

Install the dependencies

```sh
$ cd people
$ yarn
```

Add the correct _apiKey_ and _apiUrl_ to next.config.js (see next-example.config.js as a template!)

Be sure to turn off CORS in your browser, so it plays friendly with the API.

Then run

```sh
$ yarn dev
```
